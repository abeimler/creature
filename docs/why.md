# Why benchpress?

The modern developer is faced with a rich variety of language alternatives to C++; however, C++ is still the choice of professionals facing demanding performance requirements. Despite this fact, there are few (if any) popular performance benchmarking frameworks.

Benchpress is inspired by Catch and by Golang's benchmark functionality.

## Key Features

- Easy to get started. Just download benchpress.hpp, #include it and you're ready.
- No external dependencies, just a C++11 compatible compiler.
- Benchmarks are named using free-form strings.
- Easily benchmark single-threaded and multi-threaded performance.
- Reliably capture key performance metrics such as time and throughput.
